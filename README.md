## [ Project Designation: Soul Leveling 'The System' ]

**Interface Simulation:** Hunter System (Solo Leveling Variant)
**Current State:** Fully Operational - Web Application Layer
**Version Designation:** `v1.1.1` (Codename: Shadow Integration & System Enhancements)
**Core Matrix:** `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6+)`, `PWA`

### // System Directive: Primary Objective

> _"Arise."_ - Reimagined.

This project materializes the System interface recognized by Awakened Hunters. It functions as a dynamic web application, leveraging the paradigm of leveling, stats, skills, and gate conquest as a framework for interactive personal development simulation and reflection. Monitor vital signs, accept system directives (Quests), overcome simulated dimensional rifts (Gates), acquire artifacts (Items & Equipment), hone abilities (Skills), and witness the unfolding of latent potential.

### // System Log: Integrated Functionalities [v1.1.1]

*   **[ Status Window ]:** Real-time display of User Vitals (`Name`, `Title`, `Level`, `Class/Rank`, `HP/MP`, `EXP`) and Core Attunements (`Awakening`, `Intuition`, `Energy`, `Willpower`, `Resonance`) via Radar Chart interface. Includes `Stat Point` allocation display and interaction (+ buttons).
*   **[ Quest Log ]:** Manages `Daily Rituals`, System-Issued `Main Quests` (triggered by state/events), and observed `Synchronicities`. Completion yields variable rewards (`EXP`, `Stats`, `Currency`, `Items`, `Skills`) with associated `Rarity`. Tracks Alignment shifts. Includes specific `Awakening Quest` protocol.
*   **[ Gate Simulation ]:** Generates dimensional Gates (`Fear`, `Doubt`, `Anger`, etc.) with random chance of high-intensity `<span class="rarity-epic">Red Gates</span>`. Requires specific actions (Journaling, Breathwork) or simulated `Combat Trials` (placeholder) for clearance, incorporating adjusted difficulty and enhanced `Rewards` (including higher Rarity Items/Skills) for Red Gates. Includes `Awakening Trial` gate for Rank S.
*   **[ Ascension Protocol ]:** Facilitates user progression through Hunter Ranks (`C` > `B` > `A` > `S` > `SS` > `Monarch`) via leveling and successful completion of the `Awakening Trial` (for Rank S). Unlocks inherent `Abilities` and advanced System functions (`Shadow Soldiers`, `Monarch Domain`) at higher Ranks. Potential for `Soul Class` evolution based on stat thresholds.
*   **[ Shadow/Companion Management ]:** Summon `Inner Guides / Shadows` (Rank C-A) visually re-skinned as `Shadow Soldiers` (Rank S+). Implements `Leveling` system for companions via EXP gain or direct `Fragment` expenditure, enhancing their passive effects.
*   **[ Skill System ]:** Learnable `Passive` and `Active Skills` via Quests, Gates, or `Skill Books`. Active skills have `Mana Costs` and `Cooldowns` visualized in UI. Passive skills automatically modify calculations via the `Effects System`. Skill details available on interaction.
*   **[ Inventory & Equipment ]:** Store acquired `Items`. Equip gear into designated `Slots`. Item effects contribute directly to effective stats. Items have `Rarity`, `Sell Values`, and can be used or sold.
*   **[ Effects Engine ]:** Dynamically calculates effective stats, EXP gains, and currency modifiers by aggregating bonuses/penalties from `Equipment`, `Skills`, `Companions`, `Titles`, `Blessings`, and temporary effects.
*   **[ Simulated AI Narrator ]:** Enhanced context-aware System messages using varied `Archetypes`. Provides warnings, reacts to events, references `Memory Echoes`, offers expanded `Guided Intent` suggestions.
*   **[ Akashic Exchange (Shop) ]:** Purchase defined `Items` using `Karma`, `Fragments`, `Tokens`. Item rarity displayed. Selling of non-equipped inventory items implemented.
*   **[ Alignment & Blessings ]:** User actions subtly shift `Alignment`. Reaching thresholds activates temporary `Blessings` with passive effects, displayed in HUD.
*   **[ Title System w/ Effects ]:** Earned `Titles` provide passive gameplay effects managed by the `Effects System`.
*   **[ Journal & Timeline ]:** Integrated `Soul Journal` with tagging/prompts. Visual `Spiritual Timeline` tracks key events.
*   **[ Karma Mirror ]:** Provides simulated insight into energy balance and patterns.
*   **[ Monarch's Domain ]:** Endgame active ability for Rank M with significant buffs, daily usage limit, and cooldown.
*   **[ System Commands ]:** Toggleable text input for direct interaction (`status`, `quests`, `inv`, `eq`, `skills`, `use`, `equip`, `unequip`, `allocate`, `daily complete`, `help`).
*   **[ Persistence & PWA ]:** Saves progress via `localStorage` (v1.1.1 key). JSON Import/Export. Installable PWA with updated Service Worker caching all assets.
*   **[ Configuration & Dev Mode ]:** Settings panel operational. Developer Mode includes cheats for all systems.
*   **[ UI/UX Polish ]:** Includes number ticking, refined modal states, enhanced hover/interaction cues, notification system, ARIA attributes.
*   **[ Code Structure ]:** Refactored using `constants.js`, `items.js`, `skills.js`, `notifications.js`, `ui_interactions.js`, `utils.js`.
